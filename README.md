# Project 1 Multi-threaded programming and evaluation of performance.

We had to implement 3 simple multi-threaded algorithms and test their performance on a 32 core machine. Thoses algorithms are : Dining Philosophers, 
WriterReader and ProducerConsumer. After that, we had to implement test-and-set and test-and-test-and-set algorithms in inline assembly. 
Create a custom semaphore with those spinlock and rewrite the 3 algorithms with the custom semaphore.
